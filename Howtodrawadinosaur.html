    <li>First, draw a circle to where you want the head.</li>
    <li>Next, draw an oval slightly smaller than the circle.</li>
    <li>Erase the oval in the circle.</li>
    <li>Draw four small ovals near the head as arms. I will put two of the ovals connected 
      together and the same as the other two with two ovals slightly below the other two 
      ovals connected together.</li>
