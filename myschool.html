    <h1>My School Day!</h1>
    <p>On  last Thursday, me and my classmates went to the Grand Canal to study its inhabitants.
        It was amazing! It was filled with all sorts of creatures, like bees and dragonflies and even 
        ducks! Man, it was amazing. We stayed there for a whopping 2 hours! At 11:00, we came back VERY
        exhausted and hungry. But first we had to play before we could eat. It was wild, a yard time filled 
        with screams of laughter, and shouts of joy. It was crazy! Then after that, we ate! It didn't sound like
        a loud classroom filled with burps and chomps. We were more of a talkative kind. So it WAS a loud classroom, only 
        to be heard of laughs and conversations. Ok... I, uh, was one of the few who didn't talk for a while,
        only to be fired up for maths, Irish and English.
