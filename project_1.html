       <h1>ðŸŒŽ EARTH Acrostic Poem ðŸŒŽ</h1>
       <h2>By Elsa Khairil</h2>
       <p>Earth is a planet among the eight,</p>
       <p>A planet where we people live.</p>
       <p>Rocks, cliffs and mounds of dust,</p>
       <p>Tigers and lions in jungles they thrive.</p>
       <p>How wonderful can this planet be?</p>




       <p>Small question : How was this poem?</p>
